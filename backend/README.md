# Express.js

This template provides a minimal setup for an Express.js server.

# Getting Started

To start developing, do the following:
- Open a terminal in this directory.
- Run 'npm i' to install dependencies.
- Run 'npm i -g nodemon' to install nodemon globally.
- Run 'nodemon index.js' to start the dev server.

# Testing

To test your server individually, I recommend using Postman [https://www.postman.com/downloads/].
